# Minimalist Neovim theme

Minimalistic style. All colors are chosen & hand tuned manually with love

Styles
- Focus on keywords with minimal visual noise
- Customized for R, Julia, Vimscript, etc
- 3 light colors: matching colors and good contrast for plots
- Dark colors for everything else e.g. comments, operators, brackets, quotes
- Consistent styles for everything mentioned above
- Syntax highlighting styles

_(It's usable but too messy coz I just came back to Neovim a month ago. To be refactor, cleanup, etc)_
